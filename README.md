# SDA Hymnal

An Android hymnal app for the Seventh-Day Adventist hymnals. Heavily inspired by [Hymnal-Xamarin](https://github.com/isax5/Hymnal-Xamarin) which is not updated anymore because of a deprecated framework. The hymnal text and sheet music is taken from that project as well.

This app is still in active development.
